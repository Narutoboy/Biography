Smartest Man in the World

A doctor, a lawyer, a little boy and a priest were out for a Sunday afternoon flight on a small private plane. Suddenly, the plane developed engine trouble. In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane started to go down. Finally, the pilot grabbed a parachute and yelled to the passengers that they better jump, and he himself bailed out.

Unfortunately, there were only three parachutes remaining.

The doctor grabbed one and said Im a doctor, I save lives, so I must live, and jumped out.

The lawyer then said, Im a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world. I deserve to live. He also grabbed a parachute and jumped.

The priest looked at the little boy and said, My son, Ive lived a long and full life. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Take the last parachute and live in peace.

The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, Not to worry Father. The smartest man in the world just took off with my back pack.

    Moral: Your job doesnt always define you, but being a Good Human being Does.
