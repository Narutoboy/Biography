The Reflection of Your Actions

A man and his son were going through the forest hills. Suddenly, the boy fell down on the trail and screamed with a pain, Aah! Surprisingly, he heard the same voice from the mountain, Aah! Curiously, the boy shouted, Who is this? But the voice replied the same, Who is this? He got angry, and shouted again, You are stupid! And again the voice replied the same, You are stupid!

Annoyed By this, the boy asked his father, Father, What is going on? Who is this? The Father replied, Son, Pay attention. The father shouted, You are very nice. And the voice responded the same, You are very nice! The father again shouted, Thank you. And the voice again responded the same, Thank you! The son was very surprised but he still could not understand what was happening.

The father explained, Son, people call it resonance, but this is the truth of the life. The life is a reflection of your actions. What you will give to others, you will receive the same in return.

    Moral: What we give to others, life gives us the same in return. Your life is not an accident or a coincidence, but it is the shadow of your actions.
